        description={`
        HomeJab is a marketplace where real estate photographers create and sell professional photos for consumers to trade online. Each HomeJab NFT is a unique portrayal of a real world landmark, landscape, institution or home created by a local artist from your community.

When an NFT is created by an artist it is traced back to that artist with every transaction in the form of a royalty. So, the original artist is always credited and rewarded for the work they completed.  

We believe trading images as NFTs is the best way to protect the ownership and usage of these images, while also protecting the original artist who created them. The HomeJab NFT Marketplace provides a safe haven for all digital imagery, from creator to consumer.
